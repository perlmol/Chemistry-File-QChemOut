Chemistry::File::QChemOut Version 0.10
======================================

This module reads Q-Chem output files. It automatically registers the
'qchemout' format with Chemistry::Mol, so that Q-Chem outuput files may be
identified and read using Chemistry::Mol->read().

The current version of this reader simply extracts the cartesian coordinates
and symbols from the Q-Chem outuput file. All other information is ignored.
